I recently started to consider the option of having a tiny blog where I could be able to tell stories, and talk about what I want. So here we are!

# A new dawn

Welcome! This website isn't only a blog, but also the home of everything you need to find about me : my social media links, the projects I had over the time, and all the info and story of mine, which you can find in the [About](/pages/about) section.

# What's next ? 

This fall i'll certainly be a bit more busy than usual, because I'm now starting university. I'll still be active on Github (I finally have some good project ideas for the next months) and above all, on this blog!

See you soon!
