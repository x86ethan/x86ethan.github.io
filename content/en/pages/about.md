It has taken some time to get me interested in how computers work and untill I got my first experiences in this wonderful land. Let's take a look.

## My story

Ever since I remember, I always got interested in how things work. I always have been fullfilled with curiosity and wonders about how the world works. But it's only at age six that I was immersed in the world of boop-beeps. I was just fluttering around on the family computer - with Windows XP, the old memories - when I accidently did a right click. And it all started with a right click. Within a few months, I discovered the entire system of Windows XP, the main components of the OS, and this is certainly the reason why my grandparents always ask their IT-questions to me :)

A few years later, I had my first laptop, which was already quite old, and this is the reason why my father got Linux Mint installed on it. It wasn't a bad experience, maybe a little rough at the first time, but this permitted me to apprehend the beautiful world of Linux. Until age 12, I started learning all by myself how command line debian-based distros and main components of the GNU/Linux system worked. 

During this period, when I made my first steps at secondary school, I started learning about programming. My sister showed me a great thing that was called Scratch and enabled everyone, even little kids like me, to program simple graphical thingies. Somehow I became an expert on coding OSes simulators on that (For a reason I forgot I was an expert of Windows history).  
Later, I was already learning Python, which turned into a true love story between me and a snake, that never ended eversince.

In the meantime, I learned a few more languages : HTML, CSS, JavaScript (not a love story) at age 14, and later C, C++, and now Rust.

And here I am now.

## What do I do now?

As I write these paragraphs, I am 10 days away from entering - finally - the University, where I'll be learning serious computer science and developpement, which has been my dream for 15 years now. As a tech passionate, I am still highly interested in finding new ideas about how to progress more and more in the field of technology, hardware and software. I've got quite a few ideas for the future.

### Concretely, ...

For now, IT always has been a hobby to me, since I've never seriously worked as a programmer. And I think it will always be, even when it will also be my full-time job.

I do a lot of things with a computer, but here are the main things I really like doing and thinkering with:
- Linux systems, maintainance and infrastructure
- IoT, the Raspberry Pi and stuff around (these projects are the most expensive)
- Software development with graphical interfaces
- UI/UX design, I love thinking about how to set the best interfaces up and giving advices to friends
- Web developpment, especially for static websites (I hate JS and I'm too lazy to learn PHP)

## My workflow

It has been a couple of years since I started searching for the best setup, and at this point I think there is no such a perfect one.

Right now, I am using one desktop and one laptop, both on Windows 10 (ReviOS, so that I can avoid MS's bloatware). Both of these have a few usage in common:

**Coding**:
This is certainly the biggest part of my activity. Its setup is divided into two main parts: Windows, for software and web dev, and Linux, for low-level and some back-end dev:
- Windows 10 with all the great tools installed, and a few programming languages: Python, Go, etc.
- WSL with Alpine Linux for all these tasks.  

Commonly I use Visual Studio Code and Windows Terminal as code editor and terminal.  
*Note: in order to maintain a good battery life on my laptop (which I use whenever I go to the University or somewhere else to work), WSL isn't installed on it.*

**UI Design**:
This one is quite simple, I prefer using Lunacy (I tried Figma and Adobe Xd in the past), because it permits to save files locally, works offline and isn't heavy software. 

**Important points:**
- My desktop and laptop's document folder (the rest doesn't matter) are synced through Google Drive.
- The best part : all of this is organized with three main tools: Obsidian, whith all my notes, also synced through the Documents folder; Todoist, because it works offline; and Google Agenda, because i'm a huge fan of Google's ecosystem.

And that is basically it!
